# Shapespeare Scanner

This is a repo to store (and maybe adapt) the original work of Shapespeare (Whitney Potter) taken [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-DIY-Desktop-3d-Scanner-With-Infinite-Resol/)

This is part of a tutorial to make a 3d scanner using an arduino, a stepper motor and a camera.
There's not much to say about it, you should read the instructable!
